This project showcases my ability to perform regression and classification analysis using real-world datasets.

✅ I demonstrate:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualizations
- Implementation of regression and classification models
- Use of evaluation metrics to validate models
- Clear explanations of methodology and results

📌 This notebook is a reflection of my growing skills in applied machine learning and data storytelling.

## 🔁 Regression 1: Basic Linear Model

In this section, we build a foundational linear regression model using a **single predictor variable**. This experiment demonstrates the basics of:

- Fitting a linear model using `scikit-learn`
- Interpreting model coefficients
- Visualizing the regression line and residuals
- Evaluating performance using **R² (coefficient of determination)**

This serves as a conceptual introduction to how regression works and its real-world application in price prediction.

## 🔁 Regression 2: Extended or Refined Model

Here, we extend the model by including **multiple predictors** such as:

- Average Area Income  
- Average House Age  
- Number of Rooms and Bedrooms  
- Area Population  

This section focuses on:

- Building multivariate regression models
- Comparing model performance across different variable combinations
- Evaluating the model using **R², RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and residual plots**
- Understanding multicollinearity and improving model reliability

The combination of these two approaches highlights my ability to move from foundational analysis to more robust, real-world modeling.
