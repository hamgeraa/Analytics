This project showcases my ability to perform regression and classification analysis using real-world datasets.

✅ I demonstrate:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualizations
- Implementation of regression and classification models
- Use of evaluation metrics to validate models
- Clear explanations of methodology and results

📌 This notebook is a reflection of my growing skills in applied machine learning and data storytelling.

## 🔁 Regression 1: Basic Linear Model

This section focuses on building a simple linear regression model using one or more predictors...

---

## 🔁 Regression 2: Extended or Refined Model

This section expands the analysis by using multiple variables, comparing models, or performing error diagnostics...
